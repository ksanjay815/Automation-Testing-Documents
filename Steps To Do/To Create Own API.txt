To Create Own API we have to install node js and json server

1. Download & install NodeJS (it will default install with npm)
2. set the path in environment variable
3. check in cmd if it is installed or not 

node --version
npm -- version

4. Install json-server by entering   npm install -g json-server

5. go to folder & open cmd where all json files u have saved and type

json-server students.json--> enter               (where students.json is filename.json)

now copy the generated localhost from endpoints and paste it in browser to see the results

eg - http://localhost:3000/students (paste it in browser)

JSON - Java Script Object Notation
